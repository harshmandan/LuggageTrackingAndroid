# LuggageTrackingAndroid

SIH Project which lets passengeers track their luggage in almost real-time. The TrackAir folder contains the main android app whereas the other two folders are TrackAirBooth and TrackAirScanner are meant to be implemented on Arduino or similiar microcontroller. But these are simulated on Android, just to show the implementation.

The Booth app is meant to be used at the starting, and the Scanner app is used to track the location of the luggage at checkpoints.
The main app is installed on the passengers phone to track the luggage and view the other details of their flight.

The Booth and Scanner app requires NFC functionality in the phone to work.
All three app require a working internet connection.
